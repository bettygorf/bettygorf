-  ## Principles and Practices
plan and sketch a potential semester project

***Salt-n-paper: Recycling and tinkering kit***

**A kit to recycle waste paper and to experiment with embedded electrical circuits in DIY paper.**

The aim of the project is to design a DIY kit with all the tools you need to recycle paper. Each tool has to be cheap, easy to find and/or easy to make in a Fablab, by using a laser cutter or a 3dprinter. The final result of the project has to be a compact and easy-to-use kit.

Why should you produce your own paper?

1. Because it's fun

2. Because it's eco-friendly

3. Because you can merge paper and conductive materials to create paper embedded circuits (the last and my favorite part of the project).

The kit will include a ***recycling-paper-cookbook*** with instructions and tips.

Ps.
Thanks to [Fiore](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2014/students/basile.fiore/) for the name of the project.
All the rest is just my own sweat and fun.


-  **Project Management**
build a personal site in the class archive describing you and your final project



-  **Computer-Aided Design**
model a possible final project, and post it on your class page

-  **Computer-Controlled Cutting**
design, make, and document a press-fit construction kit

-  **Electronics Production**
make the FabISP in-circuit programmer

-  **3D Scanning and Printing**
design and 3D print an object (small, few cm) that could not be made subtractively
3D scan an object (and optionally print it)

-  **Electronics Design**
redraw the echo hello-world board,
add (at least) a button and LED (with current-limiting resistor)
check the design rules, and make it

-  **Embedded Programming**
read a microcontroller data sheet
program your board to do something, with as many different programming languages
and programming environments as possible

-  **Computer-Controlled Machining**
make something big

-  **Molding and Casting**
design a 3D mold, machine it, and cast parts from it
