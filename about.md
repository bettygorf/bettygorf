I always had interest in DIY, in learning how to make things by myself and how they work. 
In 1989 I was using a Commodore 64 at school to draw stuff and that was my favourite class. In 2002 I bought a sewing machine, I learnt to use it by myself for my first project of contemporary art. I went on working in the field, in teams as well, exhibiting in Italy and abroad both individually and in art collectives such as [Liquid Cat](http://www.liquidcat.org) and [Postcards from Beirut](http://www.postcardsfrombeirut.org).
I studied architecture in Florence, where I got the chance work for an exhibition including part of the Interaction-design Ivrea team in 2003. This experience introduced me to the wonderful world of interaction design while I was part of the editorial staff of [ARCHâ€™IT](http://architettura.it) - digital magazine on architecture and digital culture. Since 2009 I was focusing my research on computer science history and design, with [papers](http://hapoc2013.sciencesconf.org/26754) and lectures about the very first [mainframe computer by Olivetti](http://www.aisdesign.org/aisd/ettore-sottsass-jr-e-il-design-dei-primi-computer-olivetti). I have a long time experience in events organization and communication, both for press and digital media.
My interests spread from digital fabrication to wearable tech, history of computer science, contemporary art, graphic design as well as traditional craftsmanship. I am currently working in the field of E-textiles and wearable technology ([Plug and Wear](http://www.plugandwear.com)) teaching workshops in events such as FAB10 or Rome Maker Faire. I am part of [Fablab Cascina](http://www.fablabcascina.org) staff, where I am practicing digital fabrication.
