## Salt-n-paper: Recycling and tinkering kit

**A kit to recycle waste paper and to experiment with embedded electrical circuits in DIY paper.**

The aim of the project is to design a DIY kit with all the tools you need to recycle paper. Each tool has to be cheap, easy to find and/or easy to make in a Fablab, by using a laser cutter or a 3dprinter. The final result of the project has to be a compact and easy-to-use kit.

Why should you produce your own paper?

1. Because it's fun

2. Because it's eco-friendly

3. Because you can merge paper and conductive materials to create paper embedded circuits (the last and my favorite part of the project).

The kit will include a ***recycling-paper-cookbook*** with instructions and tips.

Ps.
Thanks to [Fiore](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2014/students/basile.fiore/) for the name of the project.
All the rest is just my own sweat and fun.
