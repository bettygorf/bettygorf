First of all I had to draw my file. I used Illustrator. It's just my nickname (bettygorf) written in [Katakana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana), a Japanese syllabary used for transcription of forreign language words into Japanese.

I saved it into ***.png*** format and I uploaded it to [Fabmodules.org](http://fabmodules.org).

I also checked ***dpi*** to be around ***1000*** in the right sidebar menu.

Then I chose the output format for ***Roland GX-24 (.camm)*** in the top menu. 

I pressed ***process*** in the top menu and then I chose ***cut vinyl***.

Then I pressed ***calculate*** in the right side menu.

This was the output.

I saved it (save button on the right side menu) and then I sent it to the laptop we use for the vinyl cutter.

I sen the vinyl roll in the machine, I set up the ***origin*** and then I sent the file by command line:

```
lpr -Pvinyl directory/nameofthefile.camm
```

I peeled away the vinyl around the sticker.

I added the frame to the drawing for 2 reasons:

1. to simplify this operation
2. because the negative of the sticker can result in another sticker ;)

I used the ***transfer tape*** to transfer the sticker: I taped it carefully to the sticker and then stick both to the surface I wanted to apply my vinyl pieces. Then I removed the tranfer tape really carefully, making sure every single little piece of the the vinyl sticker stuck on the surface.

Here we are!
