To make something big it's better to start from something small. I have never used the CNC mill so I will start by cutting a small box for the *FabBar* my colleague [Francesca Mereu](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/mereu.francesca/) already built for the assignment.
I have never used [Solidworks](http://www.solidworks.it/), so this would be the chance.
There is plenty of possible wood [joints](https://www.flickr.com/photos/satiredun/15868308421/sizes/o/):
