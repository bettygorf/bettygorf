The goal of this assignment is to make our own version of the FAB ISP In-circuit programmer.

There are 3 versions of the FabISP. [David](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabisp/)'s, [Andy](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabispkey/index.html)'s and [Valentin](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.11/people/valentin.heun/2.htm)'s.
Andy modified David's design to integrate the USB connector in the circuit board.
We were all suggested to choose Andy's version. And so we did it!
 
How do I mill the board? We will use 2 different [end mills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_mill): **1/64''** and **1/32''**. We are going to use the smaller one (1/64'') to **trace** the circuit. Later on, we are going to use the 1/32 end mill to **cut** out the board.

After putting 1/64'' end mill in the proper place we had to **zero the z axis**.
This is quite a delicate operation because we have to do it manually. The risks are: to have too light traces (if the zero is not perfectly down) or to break the end mill if it's too down. Read later for **troubleshooting** about this.

Then we had to **open fabmodules** and load the drawing we were going to trace.

```
fab
```

Set the output process to **Roland MDX-20 mill (.rml)**

Then **load** your drawing

![04](/img/week-04/04.jpg)

Choose the end mill: **mill traces (1/64)**

![05](/img/week-04/05.jpg)

**make path**

set the **x and the y min**

**make rml**

![06](/img/week-04/06.jpg)

**send it**

A window will pop-up: the milling won't start until you press the **begin milling** button.

Here we are!

**Repeat** all these operations using the **1/32''** end mill to cut the board out.

-- **Troubleshooting based on my (and my collegues) experience** --

In case we have **too light traces**: no problem, you only have to zero the z axis properly and trace the cicuit once again. I saw it happening to a colleague.

In case you risk to break the end mill you will hear a **really bad sound**: you just have to stop the mill as soon as possible. This happened to me: when I was zeroing the z axis I put the end mill too down. 
In case the end mill is spoiled you will have to use a new one. Luckily this was not my case.
