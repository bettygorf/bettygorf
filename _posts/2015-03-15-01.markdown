*[Draft page to be updated]*

The goal of this assignment is to make our own version of the FAB ISP In-circuit programmer.

There are 3 versions of the FabISP. [David](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabisp/)'s, [Andy](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabispkey/index.html)'s and [Valentin](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.11/people/valentin.heun/2.htm)'s.
Andy modified David's design to integrate the USB connector in the circuit board.
We were all suggested to choose Andy's version. And so we did it!
 
How do I mill the board? First thing to know is there are 2 different milling cutters: 1/64'' and 1/32''. We are going to use the smaller one (1/64'') to trace the circuit. Later on, we are going to use the 1/32 end mill to cut out the board.

After putting 1/64'' end mill in the proper place we had to zero the z axis. Then we had to open fabmodules and load the drawing we were going to trace.

```

```

Set the output process to **Roland MDX-20 mill (.rml)**

Then **load** your drawing

![04](/img/week-04/04.jpg)

Choose the end mill: **mill traces (1/64)**

![05](/img/week-04/05.jpg)

**make path**

set the **x and the y min**

**make rml**

![06](/img/week-04/06.jpg)

**send it**

A window will pop-up: the milling won't start until you press the **begin milling** button.
