*[Draft page to be updated]*

The goal of this assignment is to make our own version of the FAB ISP In-circuit programmer.

There are 3 versions of the FabISP. [David's](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabisp/) [Andy's](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabispkey/index.html) and [Valentin's](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.11/people/valentin.heun/2.htm).

We all chose to follow Andy's project.
 
I have to learn how to mill the board. I have never used that machine.
First thing to know is there are 2 different milling cutters: 1/64 and 1/32. We are going to use the smaller one (1/64) to engrave the circuit. Later on, we are going to use the 1/32 end mill for cutting out the board.
