After [milling](http://bettygorf.github.io/blog/2015/03/15/01.html) the board the next step is to solder the components.
I used this [BOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials) taken from [here](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2014/students/basile.fiore/classes/04_electronics_production.html):

Soldering was a little challenging at the beginning: I had to train my hands to move precisely. I had never soldered SMD components before!

I begun from the ATTINY44 and then from the center all around, in order to work in a more comfortable way. After sweating a little bit I finally managed to solder almost everything. I was quite enthusiastic but I didn't consider what for me would become the worst part: soldering the connector!

I hadn't developed a tecnique yet (I am a master, now!) and I folded the pins one by one, resulting in a terrible connector, a nightmare to be soldered!
 
In the end a couple of traces in the board were *spoiled*, so I had to mill another board, unsolder the components from the previous board and solder them again. This part was actually a practical exercise for soldering; it reminded me a bit of [Karate Kid's "Wax on, wax off"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fULNUr0rvEc) but it worked.
Here I am!

I attached a little piece of plastic to the board, in order to make it slightly thicker and plug it properly in USB ports.

We tried to program it but - obviously - it didn't work. 

Master electronical engineer [Stefano Panichi](https://twitter.com/StefanoPanichi) popped-up an amazing sunny sunday at the Fablab. We all had to solve some issues. 

My board looked ok but didn't work. Stefano helped me and the others to find out short circuits on the board (I had 2) and he explained us how to test the circuit by setting your tester to **diode mode**. [Here is the rouble shooting explanation](https://plus.google.com/+TroyNachtigallDesign/posts/ZypkDPMeN24), thanks to [Troy](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/nachtigall.troy_robert/) for the video. Sorry, it's in Italian!

Programming the FAB ISP was the last step.
To upload the firmware on the Fab ISP I needed another ISP programmer to bridge the Fab ISP with computer trough a 6pins ribbon bus. 
After programming the FAB ISP it is necessary to unsolder the jumper close to the ATTINY.
