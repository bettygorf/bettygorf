# Home paper making #01

After a quick research about home paper making I tried to recycle my own paper, just with kitchen tools I already had at home. The procedure is quite simple:
You begin with a collection of fibrous scraps. From those scraps you create a pulp, which is then pressed and dried to form a sheet of paper.

I used:

-  paper waste (thin colored newspaper)
-  container 
-  scissors
-  hot water
-  immersion blender
-  some spoons of flour
-  (flour) strainer
-  plain dishtowels
-  rolling pin
-  dryer

1. Cut into pieces a newspaper and put the pieces in a container.
2. Soak the scrap paper bits in warm water (1 night).
3. blend the water and paper until it takes on a soupy consistency.
4. Add flour and mix.
5. Dip the strainer into the container and allow it to fill with paper fibers. Move it under the water to ensure even distribution.
6. Hold the strainer, lift it out of the container. Allow water to drain out of the strainer. 
7. Place strainer, paper-side down, onto a clean, dry towel.
8. Put another towel over the paper.
9. Press the towel on top of the paper using a rolling pin.
10. Gently lift the top towel off of your homemade paper.
11. Dry the paper with a dryer (it took me 15 minutes each piece of paper)

This was the very first result.
